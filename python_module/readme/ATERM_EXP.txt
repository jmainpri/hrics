All experiments are in /usr/local/share/Experiments/

    - aterm_experiment_splits : the split are defined in Split.csv
    - aterm_experiment_splits_tmp : contains the splited files

To go from the Split.csv file to the splited libray

    split_library.py -s PATH/aterm_experiment_splits -t PATH/aterm_experiment_splits_tmp

To visualize experiments:

    roscd hrics_py/bioik/
    ./GenerateIkLibrary.py -s /usr/local/share/Experiments/aterm_experiment_splits_tmp -t tmp/

The result of this command os now stored in biok/aterm_experiment_data/

Good runs:

The good blocks are 5,6, and 8. 7 is also decent but I think the other 3 are better.
5, 6 and 8 were used for the TRO result section.
